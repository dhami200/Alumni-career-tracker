# Alumni-career-tracker
Introduction
The Alumni Career Tracking Platform is a centralized web application built to help colleges and educational institutions track the long-term career progress of their alumni after graduation. It enables structured data collection on alumni career journeys and helps institutions evaluate the real-world impact of their education and training programs.

Problem Statement
After graduation, colleges often struggle to maintain updated and reliable information about alumni career growth. Data collected through informal channels such as social media or manual follow-ups is inconsistent, unverified, and difficult to analyze. This lack of structured data limits a college’s ability to assess placement success, support accreditation processes, and strengthen alumni engagement.

Proposed Solution
This platform provides a secure, role-based system where alumni can periodically update their professional details, while college administrators can verify, filter, and analyze career data. By replacing manual tracking with a digital system, the platform ensures accuracy, privacy, and scalability.
